**ABSTRACT**
*Now a days, using mobile cameras can do numerous types of picture recognition. Face detection is one of these recognition techniques that is widely utilized nowadays. 
These are just a handful of current applications for facial recognition; the technology is essentially everywhere. 
As instances, consider medical facilities or educational institutions where certain staff members are only allowed in specific areas. Of course, there are many applications for this kind of technology.
We aims to develop smartphone software that can recognize faces. Controlling who has access to particular spaces or rooms is the major objective of this application.*


**OBJECTIVE**
*The main objective of the  project is 
HIGH ACCURACY : Face identification is to achieve high accuracy in recognizing and matching a face to a known individual.
REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE : It should be able to process images and videos in real-time to ensure that they are usable in practical applications.
USER FRIENDLY :Face identification systems should be user-friendly and easy to use, with minimal user input required.*
